      <p class="lead">Since being an English student and especially since starting a extra course in web develpoment, I've been spending too much time behind a computer screen and not enough in the real world. Yoga has become a way for me to reconnect with myself physically, work out where I'm holding tension and finding a solution to get rid of it. Here's a link to one of my favorite teachers on Youtube, in case you're short of cash or too busy to get to a class.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Food. <span class="text-muted">"It is more about how you eat than what you eat." -Susan Albers</span></h2>
      <p> class="lead">I feel like I'm saying the same thing as many people but that doesn't make it any less true. I think the word 'healthy' gets thrwn around a lot. Its often used exchangably with what is low-fat, low carb and bascically something that doesn't give you any energy. This means that by some people's definitions a can of Diet Coke can be 'healthy'. Vegitables are obviously very important, but we need fats, oils and carbs to live. They help our skin, air and nail health, the functioning of our internal organs, the healing of our wounds. Making small choices which replace processed foods with more natural and plant based ones is all you need to do to gain a lifestyle that is actually 'healthy'. Here are a few of the best vegan blogs. </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Organisation. <span class="text-muted">Doesn't mean being cruel to yourself.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">I maintain that only planning what we are obligated to do (but don't want to do) will result in us getting less done and in feelings of frustration, resentment and the desire to give up. I have got into the habit of planning my day including my free time and evenings. I divide my days into3 parts...Work: be it school, university or a job it feels like  some kind of work takes up almost all of our lives. Domestics: Washing up, laundry, cleaning or food shopping. FUN... what we feel we never have enough time for. My sister recently told me something simple and obvious which somehow still astonished me. There are twenty-four hours in a day which means you have eight for sleep, eight for work, and eight whole hours a day to yourself. Admittedly it is important to keep up with household stuff, but if we alot an hour or so a day for it, we can have more time for ourselves than we think possible. Essentially planning your free time is a vital part of enjoying it.</p>

          pwe submit wilfully into the bliss of indifference?" - Jan Slaby</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">There will be times when we simply cannot do something, no matter how much we have planned it. We sit down, attempt to begin with a kind of nevous violence and end up anxious or bored. I maintain that it genuiny is the best thing you can do for your wellbeing to give into this impulse. Put down what ever it is you are doing. Put on your shoes and get out of the house. Go to a gellery, see a film at the cinema, ask a friend out for food but do something in homage to your boredom. Once you have submitted to its will it usually goes away on its own, but you haft to acknowledge it first.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sleep. <span class="text-muted">Hours before midnight...</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">It is true what they say going to bed and getting up early is often the hardest part of m day. But when I do it it gets easier and it changes my attitude towards all of the above. This may sound insanely unattractive but waking upn before 6 has become a huge tool in my productivity. So being in bed my 9 is often vital if I don't want to feel exhausted. I like to spend an hour in the morning on myself before I get up, eat or do aything other than have a cup of coffee. This is not something I always manage, but when I do I find I am more creative and less stressed before everyone else in the world has woken up. Having this time to myself is really special.</p>
