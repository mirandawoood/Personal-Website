      <p class="lead">Since being an English student and especially since starting a extra course in web develpoment, I've been spending too much time behind a computer screen and not enough in the real world. Yoga has become a way for me to reconnect with myself physically, work out where I'm holding tension and finding a solution to get rid of it. Here's a link to one of my favorite teachers on Youtube, in case you're short of cash or too busy to get to a class.</p>

      <p class="lead">I maintain that only planning what we are obligated to do but don't want to do, will result not only in getting less done, but also in feelings of frustration, resentment and the desire to give up. I have gotten into the habit of planning my evenings. I divide my days into 3 parts: 1. Work be it school, university or a job it feels like  some kind of work takes up almost all of our lives. 2. Domestics: Washing up, laundry, cleaning or food shopping and 3. FUN... what we feel we neer have enough time for. My sister recently told me something simple and obvious which somehow still astonished me. There are twenty-four hours in a day which means you have eight for sleep, eight for work, and eight whole hours a day to yourself. Admittedly it is important to keep up with household stuff, but if we alot an hour or so a day for it, we can have more time for ourselves than we think possible. Essentially planning your free time is a vital part of enjoying it.</p>
